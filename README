This is a copy of the real Missile Command game. This was programmed entirely by
myself, and took a couple days. Just click where you want to shoot missiles, they
will cause explosions, and if the missiles raining down on your Base are caught in
the explosions they will be destroyed. If all of your Bases are destroyed, the game
is over.
